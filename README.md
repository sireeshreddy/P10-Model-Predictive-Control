### Model Predictive Control ###

Submitted by - Vishal Rangras

##### Model Predictive Control based controller to drive a vehicle in simulator using Trajectory Optimization #####

The goals for this project are to:

1. Implement Model Predictive Controller in MPC.cpp
2. Implement MPC Control based steering of car in main.cpp
3. Tune different cost parameters such that car stays in middle of track and complete the lap.
4. Try to increase top speed as much as possible by tuning the controller parameters.
